# Mind's Talks!

The project aims to provide a dedicated platform for students to directly interact with other students where they can talk about anything they want. May it be stories about their past experiences, frustrations in life and virtually anything else they want to share.

## Getting started

From your terminal:

```sh
cd <into this folder>
npm install
npm run dev
```
